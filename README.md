Cross course project from first year at Noroff, Frontend Development 2 year study.

## Description

Our first project of the 1st year, using HTML, CSS and JS and REST API to Wordpress. 
This is my first ever launched website. Many functions are missing and code is far from professional, but it recieved exceptional feedback at the time.
Last time I checked, I did no longer have access to the API, and I will unfortunately not return to this project to fix it.
